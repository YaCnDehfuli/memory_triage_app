"""Core data types for the explainable scoring engine.

A rule is *data*: identity, MITRE alignment, the plugins it reads, a severity and
a source-confidence, and a pure ``evaluate`` predicate that returns the objects it
fires on. Nothing here touches Volatility or the model — rules operate on already
parsed plugin records (see :mod:`.context`) so the whole engine is unit-testable
and re-runs in milliseconds from cached artifacts.

The weight a fired rule contributes is derived from ``severity × confidence`` by a
single documented formula (:data:`SEVERITY_POINTS`), never an arbitrary constant.
Every contribution to an object's score is recorded, so a verdict is always fully
traceable back to the rules and evidence that produced it.
